# üî• Sumo Robot ‚Äì ESP32 Upgrade Version

This project is the upgraded version of the original Sumo Robot built for competition purposes. The robot now uses an **ESP32 DevKit (38-pin)** with custom PCB, enhanced motor driver support, and refined obstacle detection and edge avoidance capabilities using ultrasonic and IR sensors.

---

## üß† Key Features
- Dual-motor differential drive using **TB6612FNG motor drivers**
- **IR sensors** for ring edge (white line) detection
- **Ultrasonic sensors** for opponent detection
- **PWM-based servo motor support**
- Compact and modular **PCB designed in KiCAD**
- Controlled by an **ESP32 DevKit**, programmed using **ESP-IDF**

## üöÄ Getting Started

### ‚úÖ Prerequisites
- ESP-IDF setup on your machine
- USB cable for ESP32 DevKit
- Flashing tool: `idf.py`

### üîß Setup Steps
1. Clone this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AvishkaVishwa/Robot-Competetion-Sumo-Robot-method.git
````

2. Open the project in ESP-IDF.
3. Build & flash:

   ```bash
   idf.py build
   idf.py -p /dev/ttyUSB0 flash
   ```

---

## üéÆ Usage

1. Power the robot via 12V supply.
2. Upon boot, robot waits 5 seconds (per Sumo rules).
3. Begins spiral search pattern using ultrasonic sensors.
4. Pushes opponent when detected.
5. Backs off and realigns if a white line is detected via IR sensors.
